    indication that this would be the correct one.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing but dull,

    of a track, trail or any person coming through here for a long time.\r\n\r\nAfter
    a few minutes of the empty trail, Pildroy turns back to meet up with Rohan again.\r\n\r\nRohan

    too excited about that side, I\u2019ll assume we should take the right side then?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CYeah, nothing down the left, let\u2019s speed this up, we were already
    behind and this fork has slowed us down by at least half an hour.\u201D\r"
