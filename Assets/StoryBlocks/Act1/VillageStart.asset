  mainText: 'The two ride down the right path, speeding up as they go. The grass
    begins to green, more trees become visible and the sound of insects and other
    life drums up.

    

    The sun is low, but a torch light can be seen not
    too far now. It must be someone from the village.

    

    Rohan pushes ahead,
    dismounting his horse as he begins to speak to someone. Pildroy catches up and
    does the same, having missed half the conversation.


    This is the end of
    the prototype, thank you for playing.'
