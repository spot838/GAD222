  mainText: "Pildroy is sent out with Rohan to a tiny neighboring village where the
    two of them are tasked with \u201Cpersuading\u201D the village to willingly become
    part of the Faelanore kingdom.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI don\u2019t know how to
    feel about this Rohan, I\u2019ve fought for Vespen before but this is the first
    assignment he\u2019s given me where I\u2019m not just fighting to defend Faelanore.
    It doesn\u2019t feel right.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CWell you might think that
    but it\u2019s only a small village, barely even that, there\u2019s only like
    what\u2026 eighty or so people? That's barely a settlement. Let\u2019s just get
    this over and done with so we can get back home for a nice warm meal. I don\u2019t
    want to be out for much longer past sunfall, we are already behind with how long
    it took you to get ready.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildory: \u201CWhatever, I don\u2019t
    want to be out doing this for any longer than you do.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe two young
    knights travel for a short while before arriving at an unexpected fork in the
    road.\r\n\r\nPildory: \u201CThis wasn\u2019t in the brief, or on our map either.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CYou\u2019re not wrong, I\u2019m going to have a scout around to make sure
    we are safe. Don\u2019t go too far yourself, but you should check over the map
    again and see if you can at least figure out which patch is going to lead us
    there.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan rides off the right side of the path, his horse kicking
    up the dirt and grass behind him. He passes behind some trees and is no longer
    visible.\r\n\r\nThe fork in the road sits in front of Pildroy.\r\n\r\nThe map
    shows only a straight path where they are meant to be, but it seems as though
    it should be slightly closer to the left as that is the side closest to the church,
    which is on the left side of the road a not too far back along the patch.\r\n\r\nThe
    right side does show more life, greener grass and more flora so maybe that is
    the side that would lead to the village?\r\n"
