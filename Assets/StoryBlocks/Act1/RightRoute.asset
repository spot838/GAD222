    that this would be the way to the village.\r\n\r\nThere is lots of green grass
    and trees that can be seen further down. No tracks but this seems lively enough
    that there would be a settlement further down.\r\n\r\nPildroy turns around, and
    makes it back to the fork before Rohan, who doesn't take long.\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CWhich path did you check?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildory: \u201CThe right.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CSo\u2026 are we going down that way or do you think it\u2019s not worth
    it?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI don\u2019t think the left side could be much
    better than this, it\u2019s definitely the more likely one I\u2019d say.\u201D\r"
