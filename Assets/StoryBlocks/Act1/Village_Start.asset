  mainText: "The two ride down the right path, speeding up as they go. The grass
    begins to green, more trees become visible and the sound of insects and other
    life drums up.\r\n\r\nThe sun is low, but a torch light can be seen not too far
    now. It must be someone from the village.\r\n\r\nRohan pushes ahead, dismounting
    his horse as he begins to speak to someone. Pildroy catches up and does the same,
    having missed half the conversation.\r\n\r\nHe knows that the village has refused
    all requests prior to this point, but the rest of the village has started to
    fold more and more with each persuasive attempt from the other knights. However
    one girl refuses to give up and continues to fight for her friends, family and
    their individuality as a village.\r\n\r\nIt seems the person Rohan was already
    speaking to was this girl, Pildroy introduces himself\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CGood
    afternoon, my name is Pildroy. We are here on behalf of Vespen and-\u201D\r\n\r\nGirl:
    \u201CYeah yeah, I knows who you are, he\u2019s already told me that, and I knows
    what you want, same as every other shiny bucket on a horse that\u2019s come ere
    before. It ain\u2019t happenin\u2019.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CHer name is Fernin,
    and she is not very keen on the idea of joining our kingdom.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CWell I gathered that much.\u201D\r\n\r\nFernin: \u201CAnd it\u2019s gettin\u2019
    damn late. I have siblings that needs to be put to bed, half of the village to
    check up on and plenty more before the sun is gone, so unless you are offerin\u2019
    me somethin\u2019 for free, get out of here.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildory and Rohan are
    not able to convince Fernin to change her mind and must return with not so great
    news to Vespen.\r"
