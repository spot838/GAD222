  mainText: "Pildroy drags him back into the Library, and seats him down in front
    of Fernin.\r\nPildroy: \u201CYou will give up your role as Faelanore\u2019s ruler
    and hand it over to Fernin. She is someone with integrity and the courage to
    actually lead and help people, unlike whatever it is that you have been doing
    all these years\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen: \u201CAs long as I am not harmed or jailed.\u201D\r\n\r\nFernin:
    \u201CNot even a mention of your wife?\u201D\r\nHe ignores the question.\r\nFernin:
    \u201CWe were plannin\u2019 on jailin\u2019 ya, but figures you wouldn\u2019t
    be happy \u2018bout that\u201D.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CWe won\u2019t jail you
    Vespen. Now you\u2019ll go out the front gate and announce that you are stepping
    down, and that Fernin is taking your place\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen: \u201COutside
    of the gate?? Are you crazy?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CWell if you don\u2019t
    then we would have to go to drastic measures to fix the damage you have done.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    three of them move through the castle. Once they open the main entrance the rioters
    get louder. Rohan is back in front of the gate with other knights and guards
    holding the rioters back.\r\n\r\nPildroy [To Rohan]: \u201CWe\u2019ve done our
    part, now he does his.\u201D\r\nPildroy motions to Vespen, who stands still in
    the face of the consequences to his actions.\r\n\r\nA few moments pass, and Vespen
    then moves to the gate and tells the guards to raise it up.\r\n\r\nThe rioters
    pause, the guards slowly raise the gate and he steps into the crowd.\r\n\r\nVespen:
    \u201CI am no longer the king or ruler of Faelanore.\u201D\r\n\r\nShock hits
    the crowd.\r\n\r\nFernin steps forward, stopping just behind Vespen.\r\n\r\nVespen:
    \u201CThe title of ruler now belongs to Fernin here.\u201D\r\n\r\nFernin steps
    forward and Vespen addresses her as the new ruler.\r\n\r\nPath 1 Ending.\n\r\n[Epilogue
