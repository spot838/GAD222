  mainText: "Pildroy scouts around the sides of the village walls and comes across
    a small cutout in the wooden walls, likely made by children to sneak out and
    play. Dismounting and tying his horse up, Pildroy squeezes through and finds
    himself on the far back side of the village.\r\n\r\nFrom behind a tree he spots
    Fernin showing some older teenagers how to use a stick to defend themselves.\r\nPildroy
    thinks to himself: \u201CShe is someone who would even stay up late to prepare
    others after a sign that they would need to be more prepared - she really is
    the right person.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt takes a little longer for her to finish, eventually
    she packs up and the kids leave. He approaches her alone to tell her about what
    happened and his plan to overthrow Vespen and put her in his place as Faelanore\u2019s
    ruler.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI\u2019m sorry about earlier, Rohan and I weren\u2019t
    aware of what Vespen was like. Now we want him gone and you are the best person
    to replace him.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe stops, shocked as just hours earlier she was
    being pressured into giving up her friends and family to this kingdom, but now
    she is being asked to rule over it?\r\n\r\nFernin: \u201CYou want me to what??
    I can\u2019t, I have too many people that rely on me here.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CBy ruling over Faelanore you would have complete control over the knights
    and guards that you would need to protect this place. They could even help those
    that need it, after all that is what they are for, what I am for.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy
    crawls back through the hole to his horse before meeting up with Fenrin outside
    the front gate, and the two of them ride to the castle.\r"
