  mainText: "Pildroy and Rohan now find themselves at the front gate, holding against
    the mob of angry civilians. They try to ask some of them what their reasons for
    rioting are, but most of the people at the front gate are the angriest and most
    difficult to speak or reason with, not the best type of people to have a conversation
    with.\r\n\r\nA few of the civilians do mention that they're rioting because they
    have been forced out of work or similar issues that Vespen said he would fix
    but has not and now these people have no way to get food for their families and
    are now starving. These people are not lying, it is clearly visible that it has
    been an ongoing issue with how unhealthily thin some of these people are.\r\n\r\nPildroy
    and Rohan have been sheltered within the castle walls most of their life and
    focused on knights training for so long that they have not seen or heard the
    people they have trained to protect.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CShould we just let
    them through?\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CWhat?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CShould
    we just let the civilians in?\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CI heard you. I just didn't
    and still do not understand the thought behind that\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI
    know it would be a blood bath, but these people are soon to die if we stop them
    from entering. There is enough in the castle to feed them and we can try to have
    the knights and guards here let them through, we know them and they're good people,
    they wouldn\u2019t have known the same way we didn't\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CYou're
    right, I don't know if this is the best way to do it, but at this point I don't
    think there is a best way. I'll go round and inform the guards, you get ready
    to open the gate\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan tells the other knights and guards around
    about the plan and then signals to Pildroy for the gate to be opened.\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \"Alright, I guess that's it then\u201D\r\n\r\nHe opens the gate as quickly as
    possible. The rioters are confused at first, they pause, but only for half a
    second before they rampage through.\r\n\r\nIt is loud, the sounds emanating within
    the castle echo out into the streets.\r\n\r\nSome of the civilians turned to
    the kitchen, attracted by the smell of food.\r\nThe rest went straight down the
    main hall for a different purpose. Anger.\r\n\r\nThe sounds grew louder before
    they went quiet. Screams. Shouts. Rage.\r\n\r\nThere was no clear way of telling
    exactly what had happened, but several of the civilians had grabbed bags of food
    and left.\r\n\r\nThe rest that were now leaving had blood stains on them, some
    more than others but blood all the same.\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CDo you think that
    was the right call? It's going to be a foul clean up in there\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CI don't know if that was the right call, but he was probably going to get
    it eventually, the other knights look exhausted, and I don't know if we all could
    have held it for the entire night. It's definitely going to be a disgusting mess
    in there, but I'm more concerned about what to do after.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CWhat do you mean?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CWell even though he wasn't
    making the correct decisions, or very many to begin with. He still had his connections
    and at least had Faelanore held up, now there is no one.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CYou're right\u2026 We should start to look for a replacement then\u201D\r\n\r\nPath
