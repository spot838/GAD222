  mainText: "After Pildroy is thrown out into the crowd amongst the rioters he decides
    that he will take it upon himself to find a proper ruler for the kingdom of Faelanore.\r\nDespite
    knowing them for a very short period of time, he knows that this person is absolutely
    more suited to the role than Vespen is.\r\nPildroy begins to head back towards
    the village for Fernin knowing that she is someone with the integrity and willpower
    to lead people.\r\n\r\nArriving at the village by himself this time, with the
    soft moonlight to lead him. There are now two men standing on guard at the entrance
    with torches, preventing Pildroy from entering. Fernin\u2019s previous encounter
    with the two knights must have inspired some more people in the village to stand
    back up for themselves.\r\n\r\nPildroy explains that his entire purpose coming
    back here was to speak with Fernin to take her to Faelanore. This gets misinterpreted
    as though Pildroy has come to forcibly take Fernin away for what happened before
    and he is denied entry with the guards no longer listening to him.\r\n\r\nPildroy
    needs to find some other way inside the village.\r"
