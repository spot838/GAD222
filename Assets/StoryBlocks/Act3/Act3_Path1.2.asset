  mainText: "Pildroy feigns leaving, curving back around out of the right of the
    guards, scanning the side walls for one that is possibly scaleable.\r\n\r\nHe
    spots one, a dip in the wall near the top, it should be just low enough to climb
    over.\r\n\r\nPildroy rides up slowly, dismounting right next to the wall and
    standing up on top of his horse. In a swift, single jump he grabs onto the edge
    of the wall and pulls himself upwards, struggling to keep his metal suit from
    clanging and stirring up noise.\r\n\r\nHe gets up and over but only after landing
    unsteady and very loudly, he won\u2019t have much time till the guards come for
    him.\r\n\r\nHe spots Fernin cleaning up a mess outside another person's living
    space. He quickly runs up to tell her about what happened and his plan to overthrow
    Vespen and put her in his place as Faelanore\u2019s ruler.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI\u2019m
    sorry about earlier, Rohan and I weren\u2019t aware of what Vespen was like.
    Now we want him gone and you are absolutely the best person to replace him.\u201D\r\n\r\nShe
    stops, shocked as just hours earlier she was being pressured into giving up her
    friends and family to this kingdom, but now she is being asked to rule over it?\r\n\r\nFernin:
    \u201CYou want me to what?? I can\u2019t, I have too many people that rely on
    me here.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CBy ruling over Faelanore you would have
    complete control over the knights and guards that you would need to protect this
    place. They could even help out the people that need it, after all that is what
    they are for, what I am for.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CAnd we have to go, right
    now.\u201D\r\n"
