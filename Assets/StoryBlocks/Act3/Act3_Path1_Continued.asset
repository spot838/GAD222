  mainText: "The castle is in a much rougher state than when Pildroy left, the torch
    lights of the rioters lighting up the walls, showing off new cracks and damage
    - presumably from the rioters throwing rocks in their anger.\r\n\r\nThey stop
    at the front entrance and dismount, moving through the chaos. No one notices
    a knight moving through the crowd until he gets to the gate where he shouts to
    Rohan to raise the gate. With the gate lifted just enough, he pulls Fernin through
    and helps to close it immediately behind them.\r\n\r\nRohan, looking shocked,
    asks why he would bring her here.\r\nPildroy: \u201CThis is Vespen\u2019s replacement.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CWhat.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI\u2019m overthrowing Vespen and putting
    Fernin in his place.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CAre you serious?\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CI am serious, I need you to just trust me and help me make this happen.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CAre you one-hundred-percent, absolutely certain?\u201D\r"
