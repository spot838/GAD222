  mainText: "Pildroy takes himself out of the castle and rushes back to the front
    gate with bad news.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CNo, I couldn\u2019t get anything to
    help us, but if we can all hold this for just a few more hours, then the rioters
    will all tire and give out. They don\u2019t have the training we do. They don't
    have the support of each other to hold them up like we do.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan:
    \u201CYeah\u2026 YEAH! HOLD FAST MEN WE CAN AND WILL HOLD THIS.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe
    next few hours are long, tiring and draw all of the energy out of each of the
    men. But the civilians have started dispersing and they disperse quickly, after
    just a few from the front leave, the rest fall like dominoes.\r\n\r\nThe next
    several minutes are fast, and by the end of it Pildroy, Rohan and the others
    all slump in place, quickly dropping into sleep from exhaustion.\r\n\r\nAll this
    while Vespen has, by this point, been having an incredibly peaceful night's rest\u2026\r\n\r\nPath
    3 Ending\r\n\r\n[Epilogue to come]\r\n"
