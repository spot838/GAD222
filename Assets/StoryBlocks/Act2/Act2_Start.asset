    of light and the moon takes over, the two knights see the people of Faelanore
    rioting outside the castle walls.\r\nThey both ride up through the main gate
    and dismount, leaving their horses in a safer place.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CWhat
    the hell is happening here.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201CI\u2019ve got the same
    ideas as you as to what, but we can maybe push through them all to get to the
    castle gate, but it might be risky\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201COr we could try
    to find out why they're doing this in the first place.\u201D\r\n\r\nRohan: \u201COr\u2026
    we could do that, it\u2019s up to you. Vespen might get angry if we don\u2019t
