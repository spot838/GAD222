  mainText: "Pildroy and Rohan move through the castle to get to Vespen. While they
    will question him on the situation, they are cautious and do not fully believe
    the people at first.\r\n\r\nInside the main hall, the two knights ask the guards
    inside for where Vespen is\r\n\r\nGuard: \u201CDown there in the dining hall,
    but I\u2019m sure he's having dinner with Nier right now so it may not be the
    best time to look for him.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CThanks for your help,
    we have pretty important information so we\u2019re sure he\u2019ll listen.\u201D\r\n\r\nGuard:
    \u201CYour death wish.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy and Rohan both find him seated at
    a table with Nier; enjoying a meal between themselves.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CVespen,
    incredibly sorry to interrupt, but are you aware about the riot that is happening
    outside right now?\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen: \u201CThere\u2019s plenty of guards out
    there, it\u2019s none of my concern.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CWell I think
    it should be of your concern, it\u2019s getting quite rough out there are there
    are few guards with the strength to keep holding for much longer.\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen:
    \u201CThen maybe the two of you should go join them\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen: \u201CGo
    on then, leave.\u201D\r\n\r\nThey reluctantly leave, but there is no changing
    Vespen's mind.\r\n"
