  mainText: "Pildroy goes to confront Vespen while Rohan goes to the gate to help
    their fellow knights hold the door from the rioters as he doesn\u2019t want the
    civilians to get in. If they were to, a fight between the knights and civilians
    would be devastating and is preventable.\r\n\r\nPildroy pushes into the main
    hall demanding to know why Vespen would be treating his people so terribly, to
    the point so many would be rioting, his entrance interrupts Vespen and Nier who
    are having a peaceful dinner between themselves.\r\n\r\nVespen ignores Pildroy\u2019s.\r\nVespen:
    \u201CDid you turn the village over? Are they finally mine?\u201D\r\n\r\nHis
    ignorance angers Pildroy, who starts moving toward him. Vespen dismisses him
    and orders his guards to take Pildroy outside of the main hall. The guards, at
    the thought of having to remove a friend, begrudgingly oblige.\r"
