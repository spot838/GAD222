  mainText: "The two knights force themselves through the crowd to the front gate,
    pushing past starving and frail civilians. At the gate they are able to get inside,
    past the civilians continue to riot right outside.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CHow
    long have you been holding this for? When did it start? Do we know what started
    it?\u201D\r\n\r\nGuard: \u201CHoldin\u2019 this since you an he left.\u201D\r\nHe
    gestures to Rohan\r\n\r\nGuard: \u201CIt ain\u2019t stopped since then, I\u2019m
    tired, he\u2019s tired, we\u2019s all tied ere\u2019. Don\u2019t know what started
    it, don\u2019t care to know either, I just want it stopped.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy:
    \u201CI\u2019ll go find Vespen, try to request for reinforcements or something
    that we can use to help hold for a bit longer.\u201D\r\n\r\nHe finds Vespen in
    the dining hall, having dinner with Nier.\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CSorry to interrupt,
    but the hold at the gate isn\u2019t going to last much longer. We need reinforcements
    or something to help us hold any amount longer.\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen: \u201CHow
    was your little adventure down to the village? I\u2019ll assume it didn\u2019t
    go well considering you didn\u2019t lead with that.\u201D\r\n\r\nPildroy: \u201CI
    don\u2019t think that should be a concern right now, if these men have to hold
    for much longer they\u2019re going to tire and the rioters will push through\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen:
    \u201CI think that it very much is my concern right now, my men at the gate can
    hold it just fine themselves, and you can go ahead and join them.\u201D\r\n\r\nVespen
    directs his personal guards to lead Pildroy out of the dining hall.\r"
